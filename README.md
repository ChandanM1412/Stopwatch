# Stopwatch
The online stopwatch counts the time to the millisecond that passes after you click the "Start" button. It allows you to add laps. If you close the stopwatch, the value and laps will be automatically saved. If the period is sufficiently large, the number of days passed will be displayed,too.

You can configure the accuracy for displaying fractions of a second in the stopwatch settings.

Click the "Start" or "Stop" buttons to start or stop the stopwatch. Click the "Lap" button to add one lap and the current stopwatch value to the lap list. To reset laps and the stopwatch value, click the "Reset" button (the button appears when the stopwatch is stopped).
